## Who are we?
Hello, we are devOS: Sanity Edition, a collective of developers who work on software in our freetime, and just learning while throwing bricks and marbles at each other. We are a relatively tightly knitted private Discord community that just wants to have fun. A majority of our members are LGBTQ+ in our own respective, or support LGBTQ+ in one way or another.

## What do we stand for?
We stand for Open Source, and trying to open source any work we want to, or can open source. We want people to view our works and learn from them, or help us improve.

## What do we not stand for?
We do not like it when people take our work and twist it into something hateful. We don't like it when people use our works to target others just because you disagree with them. We try to keep politics and software entirely seperate, because at the end of the day, we just want to create fun software that provides weirdness or just straight fun for everyone who views it, regardless of group.

## What can be used?
Feel free to look at any of the public repos and fork it into something of your own, or for contribution! We like seeing fun things and we do accept contributions wherever possible. All we ask is you let us know what you've made out of it, and don't target anyone. Most of our repos are licensed under MIT, since it's one of the most permissive licenses, and Devin's personal favorite.

## How to get in contact?
If you're trying to get in contact about our repos, feel free to go to any of the repos and make an issue, and make it clear.
